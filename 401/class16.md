# Machine Learning Intro

Machine learning is the practice of teaching computers how to learn patterns from data, often for making decisions or predictions.

For true machine learning, the computer must be able to learn patterns that it's not explicitly programmed to identify.



### Before going any further, let's just make sure we have a shared language for discussing these topics:

* Model - a set of patterns learned from data.
* Algorithm - a specific ML process used to train a model.
* Training data - the dataset from which the algorithm learns the model.
* Test data - a new dataset for reliably evaluating model performance.
* Features - Variables (columns) in the dataset used to train the model.
* Target variable - A specific variable you're trying to predict.
* Observations - Data points (rows) in the dataset.

## Exploratory Analysis

The purpose of exploratory analysis is to "get to know" the dataset. Doing so upfront will make the rest of the project much smoother, in 3 main ways:

You’ll gain valuable hints for Data Cleaning (which can make or break your models).
You’ll think of ideas for Feature Engineering (which can take your models from good to great).
You’ll get a "feel" for the dataset, which will help you communicate results and deliver greater impact.

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is one those things that everyone does but no one really talks about. Sure, it’s not the "sexiest" part of machine learning. And no, there aren’t hidden tricks and secrets to uncover.

1- Remove Unwanted observations 

2- Fix Structural Errors

3-Filter Unwanted Outliers

4-Handle Missing Data

##  Feature Engineering
“Coming up with features is difficult, time-consuming, requires expert knowledge.
‘Applied machine learning’ is basically feature engineering.”

### What is Feature Engineering?

1- Infuse Domain Knowledge

2-Create Interaction Features

3-Combine Sparse Classes

4-Add Dummy Variables

5-Remove Unused Features

## Algorithm Selection

There are 3 common types of regularized linear regression algorithms


1-Lasso Regression

2-Ridge Regression

3- Elastic-Net
