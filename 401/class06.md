# How to use the Random module in Python
## what is the Random module basically?
it's ued when we want the program to pick a random number in given range or in a pre defined list and so on
## funcrtions in the Random module:
1. Randint
2. Random
3. Choice
4. Shuffle
5. Randrange

to start using the module you must import it in the very first line of your program:
```python
 import random
 # or
 from random import shuffle
 # to import specific function from the whole module
 ```
 # What is Risk analysis?
 ## what is risk basically?
 The probability that causes and unwanted action to happen is called Risk.
 we study the risk to see how save the process is and to predict it's happening and to be ready if it happened.
 we asses the risk to see wheather it's going to happen or not and what's the odds.
 
 # Test Coverage
 ## In software testing, code coverage and test coverage are important metrics. They are important benchmarks by which to measure the effectiveness of the codebase. However, these terms are sometimes used interchangeably, which they are not.
 ## What is Test Coverage?
Test coverage is defined as a technique which determines whether our test cases are actually covering the application code and how much code is exercised when we run those test cases.

If there are 10 requirements and 100 tests created and if 90 tests are executed then test coverage is 90%. Now, based on this metric, testers can create additional test cases for remaining tests.
## Why Should You Care About Test Coverage?
Eliminates defects at early stages
You can identify gaps in requirements, test cases and defects at early stages of your product development life cycle. It saves you from a lot of headaches later.

Better coverage
Test coverage creates more test cases to ensure superior coverage. This leads to fewer defects and work to do at later stages. Moreover, you get to increase customer satisfaction with a refined product.

Removes redundant cases
Test coverage is especially useful in identifying and eliminating test cases that don’t make much sense in the current project. Your developers can report these cases to remove them and make the overall code lighter.

Higher ROI
With fewer defects at production stages and lesser user acceptance testing defects, test coverage can have a significant impact on the ROI. All the resources which would’ve been spent on addressing defects, now translate into your profits.

Discovers uncovered areas
Test coverage helps you unearth areas of a program that have not been covered by a set of test cases. It helps make your program more robust and error-free.

Superior control
Test coverage gives you a better control over the resources during the product development lifecycle. You save time by eliminating defects earlier and faster. The saved time allows you to keep a tab of costs. And most importantly, you get to have a firm grip on the scope of the project.

Smoother testing cycles
You can prevent defect leakage using Test coverage analysis. Test coverage also helps in Regression testing, test case prioritization, test suite augmentation and test suite minimization. All this leads to smoother yet efficient testing cycles.

Before we dive deeper into test coverage and it’s techniques, let’s also discuss another wildly popular testing methodology— code coverage.
