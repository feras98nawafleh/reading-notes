# Stacks and Queues
## What is Stack?
a Data Structure that consists of Nodes, each one point to the next node in the stack with no pointer to the previous one.
here's the most common methods for a stack:
1. Push, add to the stack
2. Pop, delete from the stack
3. Top, returns the top element in the stack
4. isEmpty, returns true if the stack is empty

we follow couple concepts when initializing a stack, **FILO** (first in last out) and **LIFO** (last in first out).

***notice that both push and pop are O(1) complexity.***

## What is Queue?
a Data Structure that consists of Nodes, each one point to the next node in the stack with no pointer to the previous one.
here's the most common methods for a queue:
1. Enqueue, add to the queue
2. Dequeue, delete from the queue
3. Front, the first element in the queue
4. Rear, the last element in the queue
5. isEmpty, returns true if the queue is empty

we follow couple concepts when initializing a queue, **FIFO** (first in first out) and **LILO** (last in last out).
