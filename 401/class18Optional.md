# Encryption, Decryption and Cracking!
## in encryption we use some familiar and popular techniques, let us start with one of the oldest and better one to start with, **CAESAR CIPHER**:
Encrypting a message
Imagine Caesar wants to send this message:
SECRET MEETING AT THE PALACE
Here's what that might look like encrypted:
YKIXKZ SKKZOTM GZ ZNK VGRGIK
why? we shifted the letters by n of steps, To make the encrypted message above, I shifted the alphabet by 6 and used this substitution table:
A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z
G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z	A	B	C	D	E	F
S shifts 6 letters over to Y, E shifts 6 letters over to K, etc. Here's the first word and its shifts:
S	E	C	R	E	T
Y	K	I	X	K	Z
## Decrypting is the exact opposite, read more about it.
