# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout
## HTML LINKS:
in html, we can refer to a link using a tag, the link is puted inside the tag using href property
as an example:
```html
<a href="google.com">click to visit google.com </a>
```


## JS FUNCTIONS
in JavaScript like any other programming languages functions can't be replaced, it's a very important block and way of writing code, you simply write the code once and call it whenever you want
syntax:
function functionName(parameter) {
//do this
}

example:
```js
function multiply(num1, num2){
return num1 * num2;
}
```

A website is often divided into headers, menus, content and a footer.
these days many websites uses the same layout, i think it's the best user expereience developers reached, which consists of navbar having the most important links, head and main section as same as the footer.
