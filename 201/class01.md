# explaining HTML & CSS
## what is HTML and CSS?
HTML is a marking language to structure the web page and CSS is to add colors and alignments to the structure.

** How Pages are Structured **

Think about the stories you read in a newspaper: for each story, there will be a headline, some text, and possibly some images. If the  article is a long piece, there may be subheadings that split the story into separate sections or quotes from those involved. Structure helps readers understand the stories in the newspaper.The structure is very similar when a news story is viewed online (although it may also feature audio or video). This is illustrated on the right with a copy of a newspaper alongside the corresponding article on its website.Now think about a very different type of document â€” an insurance form. Insurance forms often have headings for different sections, and each section contains a list of questions with areas for you to fill in details or checkboxes to tick. Again, the structure is very similar online.

Definition and Usage
The <link> tag defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource.

The <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets.

The <link> element is an empty element, it contains attributes only.

When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the HTML document according to the information in the style sheet.

Three Ways to Insert CSS
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

1. External CSS
2. Internal CSS
3. Inline CSS
