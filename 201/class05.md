# Images, Color, Text in HTML and CSS
images is a very important part of any web page, internet is fullfilled with images and there's a tag in HTML for it, example:
```html
<img src="source/of/image" alt="alternative text"
```
src is where this image comes from and alt for alternative text to be showed if the image wouldn't

Colors also is one of the best things that give the web page it's spirit and meanings and the best user experience, we use CSS for such cool thing and there's a huge variety of colors supported
just by picking the name, hex code,rgb code or rgba code and so on:
Colors in CSS can be specified by the following methods:
Hexadecimal colors
Hexadecimal colors with transparency
RGB colors
RGBA colors
HSL colors
HSLA colors
Predefined/Cross-browser color names
With the currentcolor keyword

example:

```css
div{
back-ground-color: red;
color:#8827fe;
}
```

text is also very important since almost every web page contains written text, you have the power to control text by using textproperties in CSS:
 ```css
 text-align: center;
 text-size: 30px;
 color: rgb(1,2,3); //text color
 ```
