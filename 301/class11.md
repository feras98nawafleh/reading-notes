# SQL vs NoSQL
## Major differences
| SQL           | NoSQL         |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Relational Databases (RDBMS) | non-relational or distributed database.  |
| table based databases  | document based, key-value pairs  |
| have predefined schema  | dynamic schema for unstructured data  |
| vertically scalable  | horizontally scalable  |
| good fit for the complex query intensive environment   | not good fit for complex queries  |

### SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL.
### NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb.

## Additional Information:
1. What does SQL stand for? Structured Query Language
2. What is a realational database? type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another
3. What type of structure does a relational database work with? a collection of tables, each having a unique name
4. What is a ‘schema’? A schema is a collection of database objects.
5. What is a NoSQL database? distributed, non-relational database designed for large-scale data storage and for massively-parallel, high-performance data processing across a large number of commodity systems. 
6. Howo does it work? document databases, key-value databases, wide-column stores, and graph databases.
7. What is inside of a Mongo database? MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents).
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why? MongoDB, it's design makes this much less of a concern.
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database? don’t have the reliability functions and NoSQL are very new compared to Relational Databases.
