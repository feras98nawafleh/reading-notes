**Markdown** is a way to style text on the web, usually used for documentation 
You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. 
Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

### examples:
[this is a link to google](googe.com)
**this is a bold text**
*this is italic text*
# this is heading <h1> in HTML
## this is a smaller heading <h2> in HTML
  
  
 **Github Pages**
  it's basically a free way to host your web pages, an easy way to share your projects, portfolio and resume, usually the link is  
  https://your-account.github.io
  
 
  **Markdown syntax**
  writing markdown is as easy as it could be, shorter and easier syntax, you could always go to the [official docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
