**Markdown** is a way to style text on the web, usually used for documentation 
You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. 
Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

### examples:
[this is a link to google](googe.com)
**this is a bold text**
*this is italic text*
# this is heading <h1> in HTML
## this is a smaller heading <h2> in HTML

  https://your-account.github.io
